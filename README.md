Background

This competition is designed to help you get started with DataCamp Competitions and familiarize yourself with how competitions work. You work in the accounting department of a company that sells motorcycle parts. The company operates three warehouses in a large metropolitan area. Youâ€™ve recently learned data manipulation and plotting, and are helping your colleague analyze past sales data. Your colleague wants to capture sales by payment method. She also needs to know the average unit price for each product line.
